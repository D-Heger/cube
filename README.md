# 3D Cube Visualization Project

A simple, dependency-free 3D cube rendered in your terminal using C. This project is a fun exercise in 3D graphics fundamentals, built from scratch.

![Demo][demo]

You should really see it in action, the gif above makes it look worse than it is!

## About The Project

This is a small project to render a spinning 3D cube in the terminal. The goal was to write it in C with no external dependencies, focusing on the core concepts of 3D graphics:

* **3D Math from Scratch:** All the logic for 3D point rotation and perspective projection is self-contained.
* **Software Z-Buffering:** Correctly handles depth and occlusion for a proper 3D effect.
* **Terminal Rendering:** Draws directly to a character-based frame buffer, which is then printed to the console.
* **Clean & Modular Code:** The logic is separated into modules for math, rendering, input, and the cube object itself.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need a C compiler (like `GCC`) and `make`. The code is written in C99 + GNU Extensions and should work on any POSIX-compatible system (Linux, macOS, WSL).

### Installing and Building

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/D-Heger/cube.git
cd cube

# Compile and build the executable
make

# Running the executable

make run
# Or
./cube
```

The `Makefile` also offers other useful commands:

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Rebuild from scratch
make rebuild
```

### Controls

* The cube will rotate on its own.
* Press the `1` key to exit cleanly.
* If needed, you can always stop the program with `Ctrl+C`.
